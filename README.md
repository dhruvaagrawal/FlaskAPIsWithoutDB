# FlaskAPIsWithoutDB

## Part 1

*This is Part 1 of a series of Github repository pushes that I will do, starting today, to learn new things (primarily Java and Python, and a little bit of Node.js if time permits) and keep up with what I have already learnt.*

This is a very simple project where there are APIs to create, read (individual and the whole list) and update users and teams.

Moreover, there are APIs also there to add users to a particular team, list those users and delete users for a particular team.

Ideally, this would have been done in an SQL table(s), but wanted to try it out writing to JSON files (as DB).


## Steps to run the code:

1. *python3 -m source -venv venv*
2. *pip install -r requirements.txt*
3. *python main.py*
